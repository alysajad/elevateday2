# Internship Task Summary - Cybersecurity Phishing Analysis

## Date: 2025-05-27

### What I Did Today:

1. **Phishing Email Analysis Report**  
   I found a real phishing email pretending to be from Amazon and analyzed it carefully. I checked the sender’s email address to see if it was spoofed, looked for suspicious links and attachments, and read the email content to spot urgent or threatening language. I also hovered over URLs to find any mismatched links and noted spelling and grammar mistakes. Then, I examined the email headers using online header analyzer tools to find signs of spoofing or any discrepancies. Finally, I wrote a detailed report summarizing all the phishing traits I found.

2. **Email Header Extraction**  
   I learned how to get the full email header from an email and used that header for analysis in the report. I also made sure I understood how to do this step-by-step so I can repeat it on any suspicious email in the future.

3. **Interview Questions & Answers**  
   I prepared clear, simple answers for common interview questions related to phishing and email security. This includes understanding what phishing is, how to identify phishing emails, what email spoofing means, why phishing emails are dangerous, how to verify if a sender is real, what tools can analyze email headers, what to do when I get a suspicious email, and how attackers use social engineering to trick people.

4. **Dummy Screenshots Guidance**  
   I planned out example screenshots that I can create or capture to show proof of my work. These include screenshots of the phishing email, the header analysis tool, URL hovering to show suspicious links, and reporting the phishing email. I understand I need to create or capture these screenshots myself.

### Final Thoughts:

Today’s tasks helped me understand how to spot phishing emails and analyze them effectively using tools and manual checking. The interview Q&A preparation also made me feel more confident about explaining these concepts clearly. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I’m ready to apply this knowledge in real situations.
